    <h1>The Mod One Experience</h1>
    <p>My first time around I spent too much time worrying over things in my personal life<br>
    and not enough time focusing on what I needed to do. And on top of that I kept trying to compare<br>
    my progress with people who were ahead of me and took it personally. Going through again,<br>
    without being distracted, helped me realize that the only thing preventing me from passing<br>
    was putting in the time.<br><br>
    Realizing that really helped me focus on what I needed to do the second time around.<br>
    Because not everyone got the opportunity to take this challenge and I'm sure a lot of people<br>
    more qualified than myself were turned down. But it really hit home for me that if you really<br>
    want something you have to be willing to put in the time. It will never just come to you. You cannot<br>
    look at the person next to you and think about how it's easy for them and not you.<br><br>
    That may even be partially true. But, everyone could get there with the time and effort.<br><br><br>

    Alsmost as a side note: TDD was my favorite technical concept. It really helps, especially<br>
    early on for learing how to work through your errors to come to your solution. And I will try<br>
    to take that practice with me where ever I go.</p>
